We believe that automation and collaboration can transform the way we work, especially when using GitHub Workflows and pipelines. By leveraging these tools thoughtfully, we can boost productivity while maintaining high standards for privacy, security, and reliability. We’re committed to open source principles and knowledge sharing, which is why we created this site—to help each other build, manage, and improve our daily development processes.
